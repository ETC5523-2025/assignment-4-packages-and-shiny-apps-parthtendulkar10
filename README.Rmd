## Overview

**bushfire** provides an interactive Shiny dashboard and helper functions to explore bushfire trends and climate correlations in southeastern Australia between 1997 and 2018.

It includes three clean datasets:

-   **bushfire**         — monthly Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area records
-   **bushfire_summary** — yearly summaries of total burned area and mean FWI
-   **pop_est**          — simplified population reference data used in the dashboard.

The dashboard features two main sections: **Overview** and **Correlation Analysis**, allowing users to explore long-term climate–fire relationships, visualize annual FWI and burned area trends, and measure correlations between fire intensity and weather indicators.

Features:

-   🔥 **Three curated datasets** combining Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area data
-   🌏 **Overview:** yearly summaries showing total burned area and mean fire intensity
-   📊 **Correlation Analysis:** explore relationships between FWI and burned area across years
-   📈 **Interactive Visuals:** time-series plots, correlation trends, and summary tables
-   🧰 **Helper functions:** summarise_bushfire() to create yearly summaries, correlate_bushfire() to compute FWI–burned area correlations
-   💾 **Data download** option built into the dashboard
-   🖥️ One-line app launcher: run_app()

## Installation

You can install the development version of bushfire from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r installation-guide, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-parthtendulkar10")

```

## Quick Start

```{r load libraries}

library(bushfire)

```

## Explore the datasets

```{r example, eval=FALSE}

data(bushfire)
head(bushfire)
data(bushfire_summary)
head(bushfire_summary)
data(pop_est)
dplyr::glimpse(pop_est)

```

### Launch interactive dashboard

```{r launch-run-app, eval=FALSE}

run_app()

```

## Dashboard Views

- **Overview** – Displays yearly summaries of total burned area and average Fire Weather Index (FWI)  
  from 1997–2018, alongside key metrics in value boxes.

- **Correlation Analysis**  -
  - **Trend Plot:** visualizes yearly changes in burned area (bars) and mean FWI (line)  
  - **Correlation Plot:** shows how closely FWI aligns with burned area across years.

- **Download Section** – Allows users to export processed bushfire data for further analysis.

## Example Analysis

Compute the gap between traveller and worker outbreak probabilities for a given scenario grid:

## Example Analysis

Compute the relationship between Fire Weather Index (FWI) and total burned area across years:

```{r example-analysis, echo=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

bushfire_summary |>
  mutate(fwi_to_burn_ratio = mean_fwi / total_burned_km2) |>
  arrange(desc(fwi_to_burn_ratio)) |>
  select(year, mean_fwi, total_burned_km2, fwi_to_burn_ratio) |>
  head()

```

## Available Datasets

- `bushfire` — Tibble with columns: `year`, `month`, `fwi`, `burned_area_km2`. Contains monthly Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area data from 1997–2018.
- `bushfire_summary` — Tibble with columns: `year`, `mean_fwi`, `total_burned_km2`. Summarized yearly averages and totals for trend and correlation analysis.
- `pop_est` — Small reference tibble with population-level observation counts used in correlation and distribution summaries.

## Functions

- `run_app()` — Launches the interactive bushfire dashboard.
- `summarise_bushfire()` — Produces yearly summaries of total burned area and average FWI from the combined monthly dataset.
- `correlate_bushfire()` — Calculates correlations between Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area across years.
