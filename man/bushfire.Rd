\format{
A data frame with one row per year-month observation:
\describe{
\item{year}{Calendar year (1997–2018)}
\item{month}{Month name (Jan–Dec)}
\item{fwi}{Monthly mean Fire Weather Index (unitless)}
\item{burned_area_km2}{Total burned area in square kilometres}
\item{date}{Date column representing the first day of the month}
}

Derived from KNMI Climate Explorer ERA5 FWI and MODIS burned-area datasets:

\description{
Monthly bushfire data for southeast Australia (1997–2018),
combining the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area (in km²).
Data are derived from ERA5 reanalysis and MODIS burned-area datasets
provided by KNMI Climate Explorer.
}
\details{
The Fire Weather Index (FWI) measures potential fire intensity based on
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Burned area values
are derived from MODIS satellite observations.

The merged dataset aligns both sources by year and month to allow
exploration of relationships between climatic fire danger and actual
fire extent during the Australian bushfire seasons.
