\title{Correlate Fire Weather Index and Burned Area}
\usage{
correlate_bushfire(data, by_year = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables \code{year},
\code{fwi}, and \code{burned_area_km2}, such as \link{bushfire}.}

\item{by_year}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, computes correlation separately
for each year. Default is \code{FALSE}, which gives a single overall
correlation value across all years.}
}
\value{
A tibble with either:
\describe{
\item{metric}{A label for the correlation type ("overall" or "by year")}
\item{year}{Year (if \code{by_year = TRUE})}
\item{correlation}{Pearson correlation coefficient between FWI and burned area}
}
}
\description{
Computes the correlation between Fire Weather Index (FWI) and burned area
(in square kilometres) using the \link{bushfire} dataset. The correlation can be
calculated either overall or separately for each year.
}
\details{
This function helps assess how strongly fire weather intensity relates
to actual burned area over time, supporting exploratory analysis or
inclusion in the interactive Shiny app.

# Overall correlation
correlate_bushfire(bushfire)

# Correlation by year
